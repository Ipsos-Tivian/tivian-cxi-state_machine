*SVN*

* Fix problem with migrations using default null when column cannot be null

* Moved deadline support into a separate plugin (has_state_deadlines).

* Added many more unit tests.

* Simplified many of the interfaces for maintainability.

* Added support for turning off recording state changes.

* Removed the short_description and long_description columns, in favor of an optional human_name column.

* Fixed not overriding the correct equality methods in the StateTransition class.

* Added to_sym to State and Event.

* State#name and Event#name now return the string version of the name instead of the symbol version.

* Added State#human_name and Event#human_name to automatically figure out what the human name is if it isn't specified in the table.

* Updated manual rollbacks to use the new Rails edge api (ActiveRecord::Rollback exception).

* Moved StateExtension class into a separate file in order to help keep the has_state files clean.

* Renamed InvalidState and InvalidEvent exceptions to StateNotFound and EventNotFound in order to follow the ActiveRecord convention (i.e. RecordNotFound).

* Added StateNotActive and EventNotActive exceptions to help differentiate between states which don't exist and states which weren't defined in the class.

* Added support for defining callbacks like so:

  def before_exit_parked
  end
  
  def after_enter_idling
  end

* Added support for defining callbacks using class methods:

  before_exit_parked :fasten_seatbelt

* Added event callbacks after the transition has occurred (e.g. after_park)

* State callbacks no longer receive any of the arguments that were provided in the event action

* Updated license to include our names.
